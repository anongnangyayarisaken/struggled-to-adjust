      <p class="text-gray-300 max-w-2xl">
        I am an aspiring writer and IT student who expresses emotion and self-reflection through storytelling. 
        My works often explore personal challenges, empathy, and the importance of mental resilience. 
        <i>Struggled to Adjust</i> is my way of transforming personal pain into a meaningful message about growth, understanding, and choosing peace over anger.

    <!-- About the Story -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-300 mb-3">About the Story</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-3">
        <i>Struggled to Adjust</i> was inspired by my real experiences during Grade 9 in School Year 2019–2020. 
        That year, I was placed in <b>9-Mendeleev</b> while my close friends — my <i>katropa</i> — were assigned to <b>9-Dalton</b>. 
        At first, I would visit their classroom regularly during lunch and recess, until an incident in July 2019 when I accidentally bumped into a classmate named Claire. 
        As a result, I was told not to enter the 9-Dalton classroom again. 
        This sudden separation left me feeling isolated, frustrated, and lonely.
      </p>

<!-- 9-Dalton Image Entry -->
<div class="flex flex-col items-center my-6">

    The 9-Dalton classroom — the section where my friends were.
    <br>
    These images were taken between 2019 and 2020. This was the section I wanted to be in last School Year 2019–2020.
  </p>
</div>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-3">
        During this difficult time, a classmate named <b>Arlon</b> from 9-Mendeleev reached out and befriended me. 
        That friendship became a turning point — a reminder that even in hardship, kindness can heal. 
        Though that school year was emotionally challenging and sometimes overwhelming, it taught me to confront my emotions rather than act on them.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-3">
        There was a period when I felt strong anger and despair — thoughts I deeply regret even considering — but I never allowed those emotions to control me. 
        Instead, I chose reflection, patience, and personal growth. Like the character <b>Bobby</b>, I experienced anger and disconnection, but unlike him, 
        I found a way to process those feelings through writing and creativity.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-3">
  By the end of that challenging school year, I was eventually reunited with most of my katropa in <b>10-Kelvin</b>, unlike Bobby.
  That reunion brought a sense of relief and belonging, reinforcing the importance of patience, forgiveness, and maintaining relationships despite temporary separation or misunderstanding.

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        This story also draws inspiration from various Filipino crime and thriller films. 
        However, it does not glorify tragedy or violence; rather, it uses fiction as a way to explore human emotions, consequences, and the importance of compassion. 
        The goal is to promote awareness about mental health, empathy, and the impact of social isolation.

    <section class="bg-gray-800 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-5">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-400 mb-2">Author’s Notes</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
        This story is a reflection of emotional struggle, not a retelling of real events. 
        It represents the importance of self-awareness and the power of making responsible choices even in moments of anger or loneliness.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        My intent in writing <i>Struggled to Adjust</i> is to remind others that even during times of isolation, there are always better ways to cope. 
        Communication, friendship, and empathy can save lives — and creativity can heal the heart.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
  This story also serves as a reflection on what could happen if someone fails to accept the outcome of reality and cannot contain their emotions. 
  Unchecked anger, frustration, or despair can lead to regrettable decisions. 
  By sharing these experiences through fiction, I hope to emphasize the value of self-control, reflection, and seeking guidance when emotions feel overwhelming.
