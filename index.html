    <p>
      Nathaniel Robert “Bobby” Ramirez was once a quiet and easygoing student when he was in Grade 7 and Grade 8. During the school year 2017–2018, however, life took a turn when he was placed in <b>Grade 9-Golf</b> while all his close friends—his <i>katropa</i>—were assigned to <b>Grade 9-India</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The separation left Bobby isolated. What began as frustration slowly grew into loneliness, and from loneliness came anger. His teachers noticed he had become more withdrawn, while classmates avoided him out of fear or misunderstanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      By midyear, Bobby’s behavior had worsened. He lashed out over small things, spoke harshly, and struggled to control his emotions. It was clear that something deep inside him was breaking—but no one reached out soon enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tragic incident that followed was not one of pure malice, but of a young man who had lost his sense of belonging. The school community would remember it not for its violence, but as a painful lesson on empathy, friendship, and mental health awareness.

  <!-- Bible Verse -->
  <section class="max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-10 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-5 border border-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-indigo-400">Proverbs 11:18–21 (NIV)</h3>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">
      “A wicked person earns deceptive wages, but the one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.  
      Truly the righteous attain life, but whoever pursues evil finds death.  
      The Lord detests those whose hearts are perverse, but He delights in those whose ways are blameless.  
      Be sure of this: the wicked will not go unpunished, but those who are righteous will go free.”
